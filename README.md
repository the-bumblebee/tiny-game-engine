# Tiny Engine: A Game Engine using C++

We will be building a simple game engine using C++. This is an ongoing project and it would certainly take a lot time in order to build a simple game engine even with limited functionalities.

## Phases

This repo is divided into phases as shown in the list with their current status mentioned and more phases may be added to the list as the project progresses.

### 1. Develop a Math Engine [Ongoing]

We will be needing vectors, matrices and quaternions for the translation, rotation and scaling of objects within the game engine. Our aim, here, is to write source code for a 3 member vector class, a 3x3 matrix class and a quaternion class. Of course, we could use builtin libraries or 3rd party libraries for this, but where's the fun in that?
